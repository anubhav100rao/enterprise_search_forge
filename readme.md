## **Improvement Items**

-   **Document Ingestion:**  
    Expand the ingestion process to handle various document formats (PDFs, DOCXs, etc.) and add better text segmentation.

-   **Vector Database:**  
    For production use, consider a managed vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate) for scalability.

-   **LLM Integration:**  
    Experiment with different prompt designs or LLM engines to improve answer quality.

-   **UI/UX Improvements:**  
    Enhance the front end with a modern UI framework (React, Vue) or use Streamlit for rapid prototyping.

-   **Security & Deployment:**  
    Add authentication if the chatbot is for internal use, and deploy the app using Docker/Kubernetes for scalability.
